<p>Thanks for stopping by, friend; <br>
I run experiments, all within the safe space between my ears (my head). And based on those experiments, I gain fresh perspectives once in a while. I twist and morph them until it becomes something painful, or something unseen. And then, I get a strong compulsion to write about it.<br>
So that's what you'll be getting to read here, mate. Oh, and I have <i>lots</i> to say. Only if you're willing to listen :)
