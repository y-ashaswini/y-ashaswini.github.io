<p><i>Thanks for stopping by, friend; <br>
I run experiments, all within the safe space between my ears (my head).<br>
I twist and morph my observations until it becomes something unseen, something beautiful, or something painful.<br>
And then, I have no choice but to write about it.<br>
So that's what you'll be getting to read here, mate.<br>
Oh, and I have lots to say. Only if you're willing to listen, of course :)
