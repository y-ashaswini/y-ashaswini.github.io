## A Deep Sleep

*a deep sleep  
your conciousness awakens  
you stay where you are 
for a moment, still, 
waiting for the last vestiges of your sleep to leave you,  
memories from your dreams  
still hanging on to your present*

<br>

*you hear the rustling of leaves  
as a silent warm wind blows  
through your open window  
you hear a few chirps,  
a few footsteps  
and some distant chatting, laughter  
it isn't dawn, but rather dusk
and you're waking up halfway through the day  
to live through the rest of it  
and also perhaps a half  
of the approaching night  
you notice the sunlight slanting  
through your windowsill  
casting kaliedoscopic patterns  
on your walls  
reflecting off, onto the ceiling*

<br>

*your mind-  
all your memories,  
the beautiful moments you've spent  
with all the people you've ever met  
throughout your life so far  
they all come  
with desires of their own  
with ideas of their own  
an equally beautiful life of their own  
and with a clock  
that's constantly ticking down  
and hung around their necks  
just like the one  
around yours*

<br>

*and yet they'd decided  
to spend some of those precious seconds  
from their little sack of moments  
with you, just you.  
you remember their smiles, their laughter, those eyes  
those eyes that have seen so much  
before you see them now,  
now, forming their own memories  
of you  
and now whatever might you do,  
you can't take that part of your self  
away from them  
that they have permanently inscribed  
onto the pages  
of their own diary of life.*

<br>

*conversations-  
ah, so complex  
with each word that's spoken  
don't you hear  
the eons of human life lived  
speaking this language  
to express one's own memories  
and at the same time  
create a version of oneself  
in the memories of the other,  
to be stored in there  
until either their wick  
runs out of wax  
or until the needle runs out  
of the thread of time?*

<br>

*each moment-  
each fleeting moment of life  
is so short, so transient  
and yet so infinite, so full of life  
so heavy, so memorable  
and oh, so worth experiencing  
if only you pull the bell  
and halt your trains for once  
you might just be able to hear  
the stunning melody of the universe  
the harmony of this beautiful human life  
that is gifted to you  
that, despite the silk of pain  
tightening your heart  
or the cold touch of loneliness  
hanging around you like mist,  
will continue to tick away those seconds  
from the clock around your neck  
that's getting heavier by the second,  
by the moment.  
even if you aren't willing to open your eyes  
your clock will tick  
and at every tick, will etch  
another momentous memories to your diary  
a memory that you cannot erase  
memory, the only remaining evidence  
of the time you once had.*

<br>

*oh, the human experience  
how precious it is  
despite its transience,  
how eternal it is  
that for all that you and I know,  
this life is the only life we've ever lived  
our first and last chance  
our only chance to experience  
the beauty of living,  
of being alive,  
awake.*

<br>

*oh, how priceless is this lifetime  
how delicate is life,  
that even though  
almost every force out there
tries to extinguish it,  
it continues to flourish  
in every crevice on the ground  
in every crack on the walls  
in pitch black rotting darkness and  
even in scorching burning fire.  
oh, how beautiful this mind is  
it not only lets us see  
but also imagine  
and writes the memories from our imagination  
to the pages of the same diary  
that holds ages' worth of memories  
from moments not spent asleep  
from moments spent awake,  
alive.*

<br>

*how'd you then, know which one's which?  
as your clock ticks on,  
the ink begins fading  
and your only evidence of a life that's lived  
comes from the very mind that begins to,  
as you age, misplace some of your labels  
and rub off some of your ink  
it begins to show you that which you cannot touch  
and feel that which you cannot see  
evidence-  
they say it is what defines reality  
but can you  
can you possibly show me  
a single bit of evidence that proves  
my existence today,  
right now, at this very moment,  
looking straight into your eyes?  
tell me  
do you remember,  
when you woke up this morning,  
with your memories of dreams and reality churning,  
did you ever wake up at all?  
or are we all perhaps just dreaming  
of each other in an eternal, blissful,  
sleep?*
