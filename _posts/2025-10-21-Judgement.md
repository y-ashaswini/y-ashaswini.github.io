## Judgement

<p>
<i>
"I swear, it was true,  <br/>
In that moment, it all felt real. <br/>
I needed nothing more than her, <br/>
Just her by my side, and I'd have everything I'd ever wished for! <br/>
I plead guilty of having loved, again. <br/>
I am guilty yes, but please have mercy on me." <br/>
<br/>
"...I have nothing more to say, thank you", <br/>
</i>
He added hastily after a pause. <br/>
</p>

<p>
Today, we have a new case. <br/>
He pleaded with folded hands,  <br/>
His face bowed down slightly, <br/>
A single tear rolling down his cheek. <br/>
On his knees by the aisle, <br/>
He was at the Court of the Damned <br/>
Where the guilty are brought to justice <br/>
Where fate puts forth her judgement. <br/>
Before him stood large, tall figures <br/>
Darker than shadows, too gigantic to be seen all at once, <br/>
Their faces obscured by distance, hidden in sheer height - <br/>
<i>The Judges. </i><br/>
This wasn't his first time in this court. <br/>
He's been here before, and, <br/>
Between you and me, <br/>
He's going to be visiting us again. <br/>
</p>

<p>
Just then, the air warped. A vision.  <br/>
Seated on one of the long wooden benches meant for the selected public, <br/>
It felt like the a whole tsunami smacked my face, transporting me entirely <br/>
And in an instant, it was gone. <br/>
I opened my eyes - a pair not mine <br/>
I look down <br/>
In my hands, I'm holding a heart. <br/>
A live, pumping, bleeding worn out heart <br/>
It convulses, warm and sticky <br/>
Blood trickles down my fingers <br/>
Deep wounds, almost like it's been burnt multiple times. <br/>
And then, the sadness hits. <br/>
It seeps into me, almost like I'm feeling, all at once, <br/>
All that the heart's gone through in its lifetime. <br/>
I buckle, breathing heavily - <br/>
Yearning. Regret. Passion. Gut wrenching pain. <br/>
The feeling of wanting to undo everything <br/>
Trapped. <i>I have so much to give but I just can't! </i><br/>
<i>
Why do I do this, she didn't have to go through this <br/>
I should've just stayed away, why did I intervene! <br/>
I'm starting to like it here - NO - I can't! <br/>
I can't get closer <br/>
I must retreat. I'm sorry! <br/>
</i>
Guilt hits. Blackout guilt. <br/>
Crushing Regret. Forcing the wind out of my lungs. <br/>
<i>
I hate myself. <br/>
Oh, I wish this didn't happen. I wish I didn't exist - <br/>
</i>
The air warps again <br/>
And I'm back, hugging myself tightly <br/>
Fetal position, on my bench <br/>
The tears don't even flow. <br/>
</p>

<p>
A voice, without gender or form, rings in my ears -
The voice of judgement. <br/>
"So, how would you like to see him punished?" <br/>
We cast our votes. <br/>
He's let go. He's suffered enough. <br/>
Forgiven. <br/>
</p>
