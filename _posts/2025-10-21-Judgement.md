## Judgement

<p>
"I swear, it was true,  <br/>
In that moment, it all felt real. <br/>
I needed nothing more than her, <br/>
Just her by my side, and I'd have everything I'd ever wished for! <br/>
I plead guilty of having loved, again. <br/>
I am guilty yes, but please have mercy on me." <br/>
<br/>
"...I have nothing more to say, thank you", <br/>
He added hastily after a pause. <br/>
</p>

<p>
Today, we have a new case. <br/>
He pleaded with folded hands,  <br/>
His face bowed down slightly, <br/>
A single tear trickling down the side of his nose <br/>
He was on his knees by the aisle - <br/>
He was at the Court of the Damned <br/>
Where the guilty are brought to decide fate's punishment for their crimes. <br/>
Before him stood large, tall figures <br/>
Darker than shadows, too gigantic to be seen all at once, <br/>
Their faces obscured by distance, hidden in sheer height - <br/>
The judges. <br/>
This wasn't his first time at this court. <br/>
He's been here before <br/>
- And between me and you - <br/>
We're going to see him here again. <br/>
</p>

<p>
Just then, the air warped. A vision.  <br/>
It felt like the a whole tsunami smacked my face, <br/>
And in an instant, it was gone. <br/>
I opened my eyes - another pair of eyes. <br/>
In my hands, I'm holding a heart. A live, pumping, bleeding worn out heart. <br/>
It convulses, warm and sticky blood trickles down my fingers. <br/>
Deep wounds, almost like it's been burnt multiple times. <br/>
And then, the sadness hits. <br/>
It seeps into me, almost like I'm feeling  <br/>
All that the heart's gone through, all at once. <br/>
I buckle, breathing heavily <br/>
Yearning. Regret. <br/>
The feeling of wanting to undo everything  <br/>
Trapped, I have so much to give but I just can't! <br/>
Why do I do this, she didn't have to go through this <br/>
I should've just stayed away, why did I intervene! <br/>
I'm starting to like it here - NO - I can't! I can't get closer <br/>
I must retreat. I'm sorry! <br/>
Guilt hits. <br/>
Crushing Regret. <br/>
I hate myself.  <br/>
Oh, I wish this didn't happen. I wish I didn't exist - <br/>
The air warps again, and I'm back, <br/>
Seated on one of the long wooden benches meant for the selected public. <br/>
The tears don't even flow.  <br/>
</p>

<p>
A voice, without gender or form, rings in my ears -
The voice of judgement. <br/>
"So, how would you like to punish him then?" <br/>
We cast our votes. <br/>
He's let go. He's suffered enough. <br/>
