## In Pursuit.

<p><i>This is a purely fictional verse. I've sat and observed people, their actions and reactions, and this is from a very certain perspective of someone who is very much in their own head. Someone doomed in an eternal downward spiral of self-pity. In eternal pursuit of something they think they must achieve, when in reality it doesn't even exist. It's all in their head.</i></p>

<br><br>

<p>Eternally in pursuit of a perfect performance -<br>
Every day, from dusk to dawn, every observable moment you may spend with me,<br>
I live in pursuit of satisfaction.</p>
<br>
<p>It seemed to you earlier that I was just an amicable person, didn't it?<br>
Not even a crease crossed my forehead when you spilt tea all over me<br>
I froze, expression still. A fraction of a moment passed, and I sighed, smiling.<br>
It's completely alright! I said, charming, cheerful. It was genuine.<br>
No really, I didn't feel bad at all, even though this shirt was my favourite, and now it's ruined - you didn't do it on purpose, I understand you completely!<br>
And besides, what's lost is lost, right?<br>
A perfectly moderated response, a low, steady voice.<br>
A smile, plastered across my face. Crinkles around the side of my eyes.<br>
It’s genuine. You nod and turn around.<br>
I hope you can see the smile. I meant it, you know.<br>
You walk away, back turned.<br>
Routine.<br>
I watch you walking away from behind.<br>
Not a single thought more spared that day, was there?<br>
All because I forgave you immediately - just like that, without a fight.<br>
Wow, I might need to notch down the niceties a little the next time, I thought.</p>
<br>
<p>But I can’t really bring myself to.<br>
I see you all gathered there, discussing excitedly.<br>
Finally! I get to see you all at once. I quicken my pace at your direction.<br>
Suddenly, the air shifts, as you notice me. A subtle change.<br>
Wait, am I not invited here? For a moment there, my happiness was genuine.<br>
Now it dies out, almost immediately. I couldn’t turn around and trod back right at that moment could I - though if I could, I would definitely have.<br>
It'd be an open act, out of place, an act of detachment first committed by me.<br>
Well, even though the initiation was from you.<br>
So I stay, lingering. Small talk to the one nearest to me.<br>
I slip towards at the edge, corners, and I leave as soon as I possibly can.<br>
I won't be the reason for you to discontinue the fun. I will leave.<br>
Restore the state to what it was earlier.<br>
Today, I missed my largest chance at interaction,<br>
Because a sudden feeling of guilt had hit me when I approached.<br>
The shift in the air, was I the only one who felt it?<br>
Today, they didn’t see me. I faded to a level one notch lower.<br>
Poor performance. Disappointed.<br>
Now that the interaction has been tainted, must I even continue for the rest of the day?<br>
Must I pretend that nothing happened, or would that paint me a fickle character, one I'm so clearly not?<br>
Does anybody even notice my absence, do they wonder?<br>
Do they form opinions of me much like they do others?<br>
Well, seems like I would have to observe their reactions to others<br>
So I may form a comparative analysis to my own.<br>
Besides, nobody cares anyway - oh yikes. Here I go -<br>
Again I commit another blunder in my act.<br>
The moment I decide you don’t care, I commit my first act of alienation.<br>
This, you do notice. Not entirely, but just a little.<br>
You collectively write it off as my mood. Or my character.<br>
Or both.<br>
Now, I’m tainted. The performer is injured.<br>
How must the act go on?</p>
<br>
<p>I see two of you, snickering about something I don't know.<br>
I can very well approach you, and laugh about it with you. You'll not mind,<br>
And I am very well aware of it.<br>
But then, your lower barrier to entry is exactly what I must avoid,<br>
For if I enjoy your company too much, I might get encased.<br>
Labelled, grouped with only the two of you, closed off -<br>
Assumed to be in an interaction I am not actually a part of -<br>
Because if it were someone else, they would be right in assuming so, but since it’s me, they’re wrong.<br>
Now, I don’t really experience things as others do, do I?<br>
So to prevent this misconception in the eyes of my uncaring audience, no.<br>
I cannot allow myself the pleasure of joining you, not this time.<br>
I note, absently, that I had spent enough time with you yesterday anyway,<br>
Perhaps we can go through another two days of minimal interaction. Optimal, cost effective.<br>
So you laugh on, apparently unseen, and I observe you from the side, truly unseen.<br>
Feeling a little like a creep, but well. The decision remains unchanged.</p>
<br>
<p>I hear familiar voices, and look up to see three of you heading out.<br>
Two of you are laughing, the third being the one making you both laugh.<br>
The look of joy in your faces is endearing.<br>
You pass right by me - I was sure you'd notice me waving -<br>
But you didn't. I dropped my hand, now noticing the barely-visible barrier that encased you as you walked by.<br>
Ah, of course. My bad.<br>
The barrier to entry was as high as the walls.<br>
You see, you were happy. A new entry (mine) would disturb the balance.<br>
I went back to what I was doing, hoping to catch you all later,<br>
Hopefully join another jovial conversation, but this time without being a disturbance.<br>
Maybe as one among the others, the others who see a lower barrier to entry than mine.</p>
<br>
<p>To those of you whose presence I truly enjoyed and yet maintained distance (- it was a part of the script, you must understand -)<br>
I tried coming back. I really did.<br>
And welcome me you did, of course,<br>
But you no longer remembered me like you used to.<br>
My absence forced you to find company elsewhere,<br>
And you are now better off than you were before,<br>
Better off and lesser in need of my company.</p>
<br>
<p>Having spent enough time in absolute isolation,<br>
Either by choice or by chance, after a few weeks,<br>
I decided now was the time to come see you all again.<br>
Having deliberately stopped myself from walking over to you myself,<br>
And having pointedly noticed the lack of effort you made to approach me,<br>
I decided that after three misses, the fourth must be a hit. From my end, obviously.<br>
I wonder though, absently, if there will ever be a time the effort is not always from my end.<br>
As I walk over, I see two of you huddled closely together.<br>
I hear humming and giggling. You’re comfortable. I walk up from behind you,<br>
But your reaction shocks me.<br>
You went absolutely still, frozen. Didn't even look up.<br>
Wow, that's the kind of reaction I've heard abusive people cause to the abused.<br>
My heart went up my throat. I thought I might cry right there.<br>
But thankfully, after all the practice, I've quite mastered the art of masking.<br>
So I put on my 103rd mask, just to be sure,<br>
Finished whatever small talk I'd started with the one who did look up,<br>
And walked off, blank-faced, wide eyed.<br>
On my way back, neither did I fail to smile warmly at all those who met my eyes,<br>
Nor did I ignore the attempts at small talk made by the those I’ve barely met before.<br>
I do not fail to do my part, regardless of anything.<br>
But - you froze when I came near.<br>
I realised that I honestly did not know what you thought of me.<br>
Am I that undesirable a presence? A beast of some sort?<br>
I... tears well up in my eyes. Where did I go wrong?<br>
I greet the one at the exit door a great weekend, and walk out.<br>
On every front, my attempts have yielded no results.<br>
Performance? Disastrous. I did nothing wrong, and yet everything has fallen apart.</p>
<br>
<p>So I let go.<br>
I've failed. I've failed, finally, and truly.<br>
Not my first, and not my last, not unless I exit the stage.<br>
And exit I cannot, because without the stage I step into abyss.<br>
Without my masks, I am completely invisible.<br>
Even more than I am with them on.</p>
<br>
<p>Cars, buses, trucks, people, everything races right through me<br>
As I kneel down on the middle of the road.<br>
Nothing can touch me anymore.<br>
Black tar and gravel shifts under my feet.<br>
Oh, the beautiful life all around me.<br>
But within me, emptiness.<br>
The barrier was nearly opaque now, very visible.<br>
It surrounded me now, going all the way up to the sky.<br>
I get up and make my way to the seaside.<br>
It’s night by the time I put my feet into the waters.<br>
Midnight blue waters. I trod forward.<br>
I close my eyes for the last time as I feel the cold water around my face engulf me completely.<br>
Did nobody tell you?<br>
Drowning is quite peaceful.</p>
<br>
<p>I wake up the next morning,<br>
Feeling the warm sunshine on my cheeks. I shift under my soft bed covers.<br>
Today’s sun has risen.<br>
Going through death and coming out alive on the other side is quite a refreshing experience,<br>
You should try it too, sometime.</p>

<p>Why, I do it every day.</p>
