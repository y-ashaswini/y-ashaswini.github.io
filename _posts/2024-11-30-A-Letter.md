## A Letter


*The last time I opened my little box of trinklets to show you, you didn't even glance this way.
I had to close it hastily and shove it back under the bed
A little embarrassed that I opened it up for you.
You don't want to see mine, and yet you show me yours.
I want to dismiss you too, but I can't help that I understand you.
I see your feelings in your eyes, so raw, and I know I must not hurt you.
So I decide to hide my own monstrosity
And let you believe that we aren't literally the same,
You and I.*

<br>

You don't want to listen to me, you continue denying what I show you of myself

Why don't you want to know who I am?

You keep your image of me in your eyes, unchanging

Oh wait, did I just accuse you of something

that I am guilty of too? Interesting.

Oh, the things I wish I could explain, but I can't

Because ultimately, who cares?

<br>

Who cares of what could have been

Who cares about your reasoning behind your actions?

<br>

Do you feel my absence,

Do you miss it?

Did you ever even value it,

Was I anything to you at all?

<br>

Oh I knew

I knew the pains of getting into it right from the beginning.

But I wonder now,

Am I really that insignificant to you?

<br>

I spiral in and out of distress

A constant pattern.

I wrench my heart and take my sorrows with me

To a beach and contemplate, looking over the deep blue sea

Pledging to leave it all behind and start afresh

But why is it, that the moment I see you again

I realise that I still don't hate you?

I can't bring myself to, even if I tried to

Oh, my heart, if only you knew,

I'd forgive you a thousand times if I had to!

<br>

But after all the misery

Who are you even, really

What are you

But a thought in my mind

An experience, a memory?

This story is about me, remember?

Just me.

<br>

Though the sheer insignificance

Of my existence hurts me sometimes

Even though you can't see me,

I’m right here

<br>

Who cares, nothing matters in this world

We only go on acting like it does.

Everything’s puny, meaningless, opaque

Or beautiful, if you prefer the sweeter flavor.

You are as crucial to this world

As this little leaf here on the branch.

Self is an illusion

And yet we envy another's percieved version of self.

You just *can’t* know something beyond a point here, apparently.

How is one expected to navigate

A foreign scape with no rules, no reality,

And no clue of what might be their role in the Lore?

*Sighs*

Funny little world.
