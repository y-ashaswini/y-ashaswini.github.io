## The Plight of Merlin

*(Reference: The 5 Seasons of Merlin by BBC)*

<br> 

I find it particularly interesting how the entire show, spanning 5 seasons and 5 years, is entirely about going to great lengths only to fail.

Merlin Emrys, the central character, is a character that is known as the "child of magic" himself. There are times in the show when mystical creatures tell him that _some destinies are so set in stone, so inevitable, that they can only go one way and no other_, and that _sometimes, some lives hold the power to completely change the world in such a way, that older creatures with lives much longer have been waiting in anticipation for thousands of years for his birth_. The beginning of the show is all about him being made aware of this _larger picture_, this larger-than-life cause, this sacred journey that he has been entrused with (by whom?).

He is a human born of magic, meant to _completely_ transform the world as they knew it then, through a destiny that’s tied to protecting the life and shaping the thoughts and opinions of Arthur, the then prince, soon to be king. 

Life goes on pretty merrily in the first few seasons where Merlin himself is only slowly realising just how powerful he actually is, all to serve this one purpose that's been set in stone for him. But as the seasons go by, we get closer and closer to the deciding moment, the very moment that he was born and made to face all that to he faced to avoid - the one where Arthur, now the King, is stabbed by a trusted friend and killed in battle.

You must notice how he is always, through people who willingly sacrificed their lives for the purpose, made aware of key dangerous moments in the future that ultimately build up to that one moment, that Merlin must now, with this hazy knowledge of a part of the future, try his best to avoid. He complains a little but owing to his nature decides that he must do everything he can to prevent it, and even unwillingly dirties his hands in blood and murder to prevent those moments in time, but interestingly, regardless of whatever he does, either he isn’t able to change it at all, or ends up being the reason for causing it. This pattern continues, every single time, right until the very end.

But do you notice the subtle duality?

Ouroboros. The snake eating its own tail, infinitely, to no end. Running away from something, to end up in the very spot that you were running away from. But that’s how destiny (for those who believe in it) works, right?

What really amuses me is the how the narrative (and basically the entire lore, carried on by hundereds of generations since the story was first written) is all about _trying to prevent the inevitable_. All those millions of people who died so he could live, only because he was destined to _TRY_ to change what was set in stone - the death of the king Arthur.

It’s like, _"this is what happens in the future, destiny is inevitable and nobody can escape it. Yoy're born into this life as Merlin and you've got no escape, but the same unyielding destiny also predicts the death of this prince, which you must avoid at all costs"_. See it?Destiny is inevitable, that’s why I'm here, but that's my purpose in this destined life too- to fight against it- what! A story set for tragedy? A losing game?

It's like riding an enormous oceanic wave and being told by others riding beside you that _you're the one that has to stop the wave!_ It’s like being told to eat yourself up entirely with your own mouth (gross, but you get the idea). It's simply impossible, a contradiction!


Because eating yourself entirely is only possible if you let yourself be eaten by another entity. Stopping the wave while riding on it yourself is only possible if you somehow outrun the wave and get off the wave yourself. Or, maybe if there is another entity that's _not_ on your wave, that stops it. You need another dimension, an outside force. 

But with the currently linear flow of time that we percieve, we can’. The laws simply do not allow it.

Either a new dimension in space, or a new direction in time. Only then can one change... the unchangeable (?). So, where do we get either of these from? Ah, a question for the ages. *Sighs*.
