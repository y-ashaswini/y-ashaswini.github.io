## A Night in January

*Slipping away into the void
Not dark really, but more empty, resigned.
To finally get out of your delusions and confront reality,
To make terms with your own and other's choices of what it is -
Is surely the hardest feeling there is, don’t  you think?
It *is* hard and, to make things worse,
Not at all rare.*

<br>

On a late winter night in January
Snowflakes freckle the beauttiful night, floating down slowly
You stare from behind a delicate veil of glass
And occassionally, through the half-opened window,
There comes drifiting in a soft cold breeze,
A breeze that brings a shiver down your spine

<br>

You feel a certain warmth where your heart must be,
And you are delighted to find 
That depite everything, in this divine moment in the timeline
You are *content*.
You can’t imagine giving away this magical moment
For *anything* else in the world.
In this moment, everything’s beautiful, and you're grateful.
As you tip your head backwards a little 
And rest it on the wooden frame of the coffee shop,
Letting the warmth from the homely fireplace light up the insides of your shut eyelids
You let out a sigh, a small smile resting on your lips.

<br>

But strangely, as you live on, stretching this moment,
This moment of perfect peace and serenity,
The small huff of sigh seems to drag on, tugging at something *else*
A strange feeling, something you can’t place
The back of your eyes burn, and your throat constricts
Tears! You feel two little droplets trickling down the side of your nose
*Are these tears of joy? But why then do I feel like wailing!*
You open your eyes, and they come resting down on the table across your corner
On the other side of the coffee shop, away from your dim corner, 
Sit a bunch of excited young people huddled close, chipring
You watch them, refocusing your vision, 
As the heavy winter air is sliced in moments of suddenness
by their low, fast whispers, collective snorts and loud giggles.
You stare at them absently for a while. Your eyebrows furrow.
I don't envy them, I'm far from lonely. I've got plenty of people I can call friends! An amazing family, good friends, I have everything.
But why do I feel as if they have something that I don't?

<br>

You wonder, are people just pretending? 
Does being sociable and surrounded by a group of friends (and i mean GOOD friends even, not the fake ones) -
All come down to pretending that they care?
Even when it feels like they don’t, even when it all feels like a lie?
I don't know about you, but those around me are
Good, for sure, and a real inspiration,
But *one act* is all it takes
For all of it to evaporate, in a second.
They don't even look back,
Never do they try to reconcile what they ruined
Makes me think, if they even considered it worth protecting
In the first place.
Had it always been me
Who tried to stick along and hope
That despite the emptiness in my own heart
I *do* make you feel loved,
Was it me who tried to keep it going and hope
That despite all evidence to the contrary,
You might, just might, eventually see me as a friend,
A friend worth keeping, a friendship worth protecting
But come on, of course im over-reacting -
Who am I to expect
That others be so delibrate and careful with my heart
Well, why should they, what do they owe!
They don't even know you, and they have others whom they care about
A lot, lot more than you.
Sure, it was me who tried, all this time.
But only in my eyes, it seems.

<br>

Because now, it looks like you were also holding on
To a string long gone taught
You were only looking for the perfect reason,
The one incident to back away
And spare both me and yourself
The trouble of pretending.

<br>

And then it happens, maybe from your end or maybe mine
And neither of us ever make an attempt to reconcile
Because it can no longer go back to what it was, right?
I don't know about you, but I think I know you now.
I can't care as much as I did earlier, and neither can I expect the same from you
It’s much too difficult to address it and put it through
You see, I can't accuse. I don't even consider it your fault, no not at all,
Because i understand! 
I can myself come up with so many reasons
For why you would have done what you did,
You don’t even need to utter a single word in your defense
I will defend you, and as the judge, I declare you free of guilt.
I will spare you the trouble of facing this weird mess,
I ow you atleast this much.
The discussion ends before it even starts,
All in my mind, in the void.
It’s different now between us,
And its much much easier to remain in silence
The silence that rings across the hall
Like when glass breaks upon contact with the marble floor
And eventually, the ringing stops,
And we can both go on pretending that it never happened.

<br>

So *is* it just the pretentiousness that keeps it going, right?
Because without it, every relation is only for once,
Never repairable, never ammendable
A candle waiting to melt out, expend its lifetime
And with that knowledge, I am bound to try much as I can
To feel the heat of the precious, fleeting, beautiful candlelight
With intent and a foreboding sorrow
Because with every tick of the clock, 
I know that the wax is melting
And there seems to be nothing that I can do
To slow it down, reverse it, or stop it.

<br>

The girl who had once shared cupcakes with you,
Now an outsider, unknown, as if we’d never met
The boy who once shared his deepest secrets with you,
Now a nameless unsaved contact on your phone
The list goes on, its endless, infinite
Humans who come without a reason
And leave just as fast, without an explaination, 
Without a final goodbye.
Oh, everything that could have been!
If only... if only what?
If only I was someone else and not me?

<br>

Your eyes unglaze, focusing once again
On the group of youngsters, now getting up to leave
Footsteps shuffle, the door swings open, ringing the bell
And a harsh metallic ringing cuts through the night
Their voices trail off, and the night settles back into a silence
You take the last sip of your hot chocolate,
Savouring it, before putting down the mug with a soft thud
Well, perhaps it *is* pretention, for everybody.
After all, much lies beneath the surface,
Unseen to one's distant gaze. Who am I to know?
Or maybe it isn’t all so pathetic,
And I just have loads left to learn!
