## A Night in January


<p>
Slipping away into the void <br/>
Not dark really, but more empty, resigned. <br/>
To finally get out of your delusions and confront reality, <br/>
To make terms with your own and other's choices of what it is - <br/>
Is surely the hardest feeling there is, don’t you think? <br/>
It <i>is</i> hard and, to make things worse, <br/>
Not at all rare. <br/>
</p>

<p>
On a late winter night in January <br/>
Snowflakes freckle the beautiful night, floating down slowly. <br/>
You stare from behind a delicate veil of glass <br/>
And occasionally, through the half-opened window, <br/>
There comes drifting in a soft cold breeze, <br/>
A breeze that brings a shiver down your spine. <br/>
</p>

<p>
You feel a certain warmth where your heart must be, <br/>
And you are delighted to find <br/>
That despite everything, in this divine moment in the timeline <br/>
You are <i>content</i>. <br/>
You can’t imagine giving away this magical moment <br/>
For <i>anything</i> else in the world. <br/>
In this moment, everything’s beautiful, and you're grateful. <br/>
As you tip your head backwards a little <br/>
And rest it on the wooden frame of the coffee shop, <br/>
Letting the warmth from the homely fireplace light up the insides of your shut eyelids, <br/>
You let out a sigh, a small smile resting on your lips. <br/>
</p>

<p>
But strangely, as you live on, stretching this moment, <br/>
This moment of perfect peace and serenity, <br/>
The small huff of sigh seems to drag on, tugging at something *else*. <br/>
A strange feeling, something you can’t place. <br/>
The back of your eyes burn, and your throat constricts. <br/>
Tears! You feel two little droplets trickling down the side of your nose. <br/>
<i>Are these tears of joy? But why then do I feel like wailing!</i> <br/>
You open your eyes, and they come resting down on the table across your corner. <br/>
On the other side of the coffee shop, away from your dim corner, <br/>
Sit a bunch of excited young people huddled close, chirping. <br/>
You watch them, refocusing your vision, <br/>
As the heavy winter air is sliced in moments of suddenness <br/>
By their low, fast whispers, collective snorts, and loud giggles. <br/>
You stare at them absently for a while. Your eyebrows furrow. <br/>
I don't envy them, I'm far from lonely. I've got plenty of people I can call friends! <br/>
An amazing family, good friends, I have everything. <br/>
But why do I feel as if they have something that I don't? <br/>
</p>

<p>
You wonder, are people just pretending? <br/>
Does being sociable and surrounded by a group of friends (and I mean GOOD friends even, not the fake ones) - <br/>
All come down to pretending that they care? <br/>
Even when it feels like they don’t, even when it all feels like a lie? <br/>
I don't know about you, but those around me are <br/>
Good, for sure, and a real inspiration, <br/>
But <i>one act</i> is all it takes <br/>
For all of it to evaporate, in a second. <br/>
They don't even look back, <br/>
Never do they try to reconcile what they ruined. <br/>
Makes me think, if they even considered it worth protecting <br/>
In the first place. <br/>
Had it always been me <br/>
Who tried to stick along and hope <br/>
That despite the emptiness in my own heart, <br/>
I <i>do</i> make you feel loved? <br/>
Was it me who tried to keep it going and hope <br/>
That despite all evidence to the contrary, <br/>
You might, just might, eventually see me as a friend, <br/>
A friend worth keeping, a friendship worth protecting? <br/>
But come on, of course, I'm overreacting - <br/>
Who am I to expect <br/>
That others be so deliberate and careful with my heart? <br/>
Well, why should they, what do they owe! <br/>
They don't even know you, and they have others whom they care about <br/>
A lot, lot more than you. <br/>
Sure, it was me who tried, all this time. <br/>
But only in my eyes, it seems. <br/>
</p>

<p>
Because now, it looks like you were also holding on <br/>
To a string long gone taut. <br/>
You were only looking for the perfect reason, <br/>
The one incident to back away <br/>
And spare both me and yourself <br/>
The trouble of pretending. <br/>
</p>

<p>
And then it happens, maybe from your end or maybe mine, <br/>
And neither of us ever makes an attempt to reconcile. <br/>
Because it can no longer go back to what it was, right? <br/>
I don't know about you, but I think I know you now. <br/>
I can't care as much as I did earlier, and neither can I expect the same from you. <br/>
It’s much too difficult to address it and put it through. <br/>
You see, I can't accuse. I don't even consider it your fault, no not at all, <br/>
Because I understand! <br/>
I can myself come up with so many reasons <br/>
For why you would have done what you did, <br/>
You don’t even need to utter a single word in your defense. <br/>
I will defend you, and as the judge, I declare you free of guilt. <br/>
I will spare you the trouble of facing this weird mess, <br/>
I owe you at least this much. <br/>
The discussion ends before it even starts, <br/>
All in my mind, in the void. <br/>
It’s different now between us, <br/>
And it’s much, much easier to remain in silence. <br/>
The silence that rings across the hall <br/>
Like when glass breaks upon contact with the marble floor. <br/>
And eventually, the ringing stops, <br/>
And we can both go on pretending that it never happened. <br/>
</p>

<p>
So <i>is</i> it just the pretentiousness that keeps it going, right? <br/>
Because without it, every relation is only for once, <br/>
Never repairable, never amendable. <br/>
A candle waiting to melt out, expend its lifetime. <br/>
And with that knowledge, I am bound to try as much as I can <br/>
To feel the heat of the precious, fleeting, beautiful candlelight <br/>
With intent and a foreboding sorrow. <br/>
Because with every tick of the clock, <br/>
I know that the wax is melting, <br/>
And there seems to be nothing that I can do <br/>
To slow it down, reverse it, or stop it. <br/>
</p>

<p>
The girl who had once shared cupcakes with you, <br/>
Now an outsider, unknown, as if we’d never met. <br/>
The boy who once shared his deepest secrets with you, <br/>
Now a nameless, unsaved contact on your phone. <br/>
The list goes on, it’s endless, infinite. <br/>
Humans who come without a reason <br/>
And leave just as fast, without an explanation, <br/>
Without a final goodbye. <br/>
Oh, everything that could have been! <br/>
If only... if only what? <br/>
If only I was someone else and not me? <br/>
</p>

<p>
Your eyes unglaze, focusing once again <br/>
On the group of youngsters, now getting up to leave. <br/>
Footsteps shuffle, the door swings open, ringing the bell, <br/>
And a harsh metallic ringing cuts through the night. <br/>
Their voices trail off, and the night settles back into a silence. <br/>
You take the last sip of your hot chocolate, <br/>
Savouring it, before putting down the mug with a soft thud. <br/>
Well, perhaps it <i>is</i> pretention, for everybody. <br/>
After all, much lies beneath the surface, <br/>
Unseen to one's distant gaze. Who am I to know? <br/>
Or maybe it isn’t all so pathetic, <br/>
And I just have loads left to learn! <br/>
</p>
