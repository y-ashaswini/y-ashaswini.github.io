## A Night in January


<p>
Slipping away into the void <br/>
Not dark, really,<br/>
But more empty, resigned. <br/>
To finally get out of your delusions and confront reality, <br/>
To make terms with your own and other's choices of what it is - <br/>
Is surely the hardest feeling there is,<br/>
Don’t you think? <br/>
It <i>is</i> hard and, to make things worse, <br/>
Not at all rare. <br/>
</p>

<p>
On a late winter night in January <br/>
Snowflakes freckle the beautiful night, floating down slowly. <br/>
You stare from behind a delicate veil of glass <br/>
And occasionally, through the half-opened window, <br/>
There comes drifting in a soft cold breeze, <br/>
A breeze that brings a shiver down your spine. <br/>
</p>

<p>
You feel a certain warmth where your heart must be, <br/>
And you are delighted to find <br/>
That despite everything,<br/>
In this divine moment in the timeline, <br/>
You are <i>content</i>. <br/>
You wouldn't give away this magical moment <br/>
For anything else in the world! <br/>
In this moment, everything’s beautiful,<br/>
And you're grateful. <br/>
As you tip your head backwards a little <br/>
And rest it on the wooden frame of the coffee shop, <br/>
Letting the warmth from the homely fireplace <br/>
Light up your shut eyelids, <br/>
You let out a sigh, <br/>
A small smile resting on your lips. <br/>
</p>

<p>
But strangely, as you live on, stretching this moment, <br/>
This moment of perfect peace and serenity, <br/>
The small huff of sigh seems to drag on, tugging at something <i>else</i>. <br/>
A strange feeling, something you can’t place. <br/>
The back of your eyes burn, and your throat constricts. <br/>
<i>Tears!</i> Two little droplets trickle down the side of your nose. <br/>
<i>Are these tears of joy? But why then why do I feel like wailing!</i> <br/>
You open your eyes, and your sight settles on the scene in front of you. <br/>
On the other side of the coffee shop, away from your dim corner, <br/>
Sit a bunch of excited young people huddled close, chirping. <br/>
You watch them, refocusing your vision, <br/>
As the heavy winter air is sliced<br/>
In sudden moments of low, fast whispers, and collective snorts. <br/>
You stare at them absently for a while. <br/>
Your eyebrows furrow. <br/>
I don't envy them, I'm far from lonely. <br/>
I've got plenty of people I can call friends! <br/>
An amazing family, good friends, I have everything. <br/>
Why then do I feel as if they have something that I don't? <br/>
</p>

<p>
You wonder, are people just pretending? <br/>
Does having a fun and good little social life<br/>
All come down to <i>pretending</i> that they care? <br/>
Even when it feels like they don’t, even when it all feels like a lie? <br/>
I don't know about you, but those around me are <br/>
Amazing, for sure, and a real inspiration, <br/>
But <i>one act</i> is all it takes <br/>
For all of it to evaporate, in a second. <br/>
They don't even look back, <br/>
Never do they try to reconcile what is ruined. <br/>
Makes me think, if they even considered it worth protecting in the first place. <br/>
Had it always been me, <br/>
Me who tried to stick along and hope <br/>
That despite the emptiness in my own heart, <br/>
I <i>do</i> make you feel loved? <br/>
Was it me who tried to keep it going and hope <br/>
That despite all evidence to the contrary, <br/>
You might, just <i>might</i> eventually see me<br/>
As a friend worth keeping, a friendship worth protecting? <br/>
But come on, of course I'm overreacting! <br/>
Who am I to expect <br/>
That others be careful with my heart -<br/>
Why should they, what do they owe me! <br/>
Nothing.<br/>
They don't even know you, and they have others whom they care about <br/>
A lot, lot more than you. <br/>
Sure, it was me who tried, all this time. <br/>
...But only in my eyes, it seems. <br/>
</p>

<p>
Because now, it looks like you were also holding on <br/>
To a string long gone taut. <br/>
And you were only looking for one reason, <br/>
The one incident to back away <br/>
And spare both yourself and me <br/>
The trouble <br/>
Of pretending. <br/>
</p>

<p>
And then it happens, the shift -<br/>
Maybe from your end or maybe mine, <br/>
But neither of us ever makes an attempt<br/>
To reconcile. <br/>
Because it can no longer go back to what it was, right? <br/>
I know you now. <br/>
I cannot care as much as I did earlier, <br/>
And so neither can I expect the same from you. <br/>
It’s much too difficult to address it and put it through. <br/>
You see, I simply can't accuse. <br/>
I don't even consider it your fault, no not at all, <br/>
Because I understand! (Even though I wish I didn't) <br/>
I can come up with so many reasons myself <br/>
For why you did what you did, <br/>
You don’t even need to utter a single word in your defense. <br/>
I will defend your case, and defend you well, <br/>
And as the judge, I declare you free of guilt. <br/>
I will spare you the trouble of facing it, <br/>
Don't I owe you at least this much? <br/>
The discussion ends before it even starts, <br/>
All in my mind, in the void, <br/>
The space between my ears. <br/>
It’s different now between us, <br/>
And it’s much, much easier to remain silent. <br/>
The silence that rings across the hall <br/>
Like when glass breaks upon contact with the marble floor. <br/>
Eventually, the ringing stops, <br/>
And we can both go on pretending <br/>
That nothing ever happened. <br/>
</p>

<p>
So <i>is</i> it just the pretentiousness that keeps it going? <br/>
Because without it, every relation is only for once, <br/>
Never repairable, never amendable, <br/>
Never do you get a second chance. <br/>
A candle waiting to melt out, expend its lifetime. <br/>
Beauty, with a touch of malice. <br/>
And with that knowledge, I am bound to try as much as I can <br/>
To feel the heat of the precious, fleeting candlelight <br/>
With intent and a foreboding sorrow <br/>
Because with every tick of the clock, <br/>
I know that the wax is melting, <br/>
And there seems to be nothing that I can ever do <br/>
To slow it down, reverse it, or stop it. <br/>
</p>

<p>
The girl who had once shared cupcakes with you, <br/>
Now an outsider, unknown, as if we’d never met. <br/>
The boy who once shared his deepest secrets with you, <br/>
Now a nameless, unsaved contact on your phone. <br/>
The list of names goes on - it’s endless, infinite. <br/>
Humans who come without a reason <br/>
And leave just as fast, without an explanation, <br/>
Without a final goodbye. <br/>
Oh, everything that could have been! <br/>
If only... if only what? <br/>
If only I was someone else and not me? <br/>
</p>

<p>
Your eyes unglaze, focusing once again <br/>
On the group of youngsters, now getting up to leave. <br/>
Footsteps shuffle, the door swings open, ringing the bell, <br/>
The sound cutting harshly through the night. <br/>
Their voices trail off, and the night settles back into a silence. <br/>
You take the last sip of your hot chocolate, <br/>
Savouring it, before putting down the mug with a soft thud. <br/>
Well, perhaps it <i>is</i> pretention, for everybody. <br/>
After all, much lies beneath the surface, <br/>
Unseen to one's distant gaze. Who am I to know? <br/>
<br/>
Or... or maybe it isn’t all so pathetic, and I just have loads left to learn! <br/>
</p>
